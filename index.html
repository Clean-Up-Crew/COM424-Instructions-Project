		<h2>2) Finding a Location</h2>
		
		
		
		<h3>Finding a location for your humidifier is not hard, but a few conditions must be met first.</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Find a place indoors. Place the device on an inside wall near an electrical outlet.</li>
			<li>Make sure the humidifier is at least 4 in. (10 cm) away from the wall.</li>
			<li>Keep it away from heating devices like stoves, radiators, and heaters.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A wall outlet in an indoor area. There's also plenty of space away from the wall for the humidifier.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Keep it out of reach of children, and keep it out of a closed room where a child may be sleeping, resting, or playing.</li>
			<li>Do not use the humidifier in a room with 50% or greater humidity. Use a hygrometer, available at your local retailer or
				through the manufacturer, to measure humidity.</li>
			<li>Make sure that the humidifier is not underneath any overhanging surfaces. Placement like this can damage the overhanging surface.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3) How to Place Your Humidifier</h2>

		<h3>Now that you have found a place for your humidifier, you need to set it up so that it will work as intended.</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Wait for the unit to cool completely before handling it.</li>
			<li>Place the humidifier on a firm, flat, level surface. A waterproof mat or pad is recommended.</li>
			<li>NEVER place it on a rug or hardwood floor that can be damaged by moisture</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here's a flat surface away from the wall. It's perfect for the humidifier.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Face the humidifier away from the wall to prevent damage to the wall</li>
			<li>NEVER place the humidifier under water flow or immerse in liquids</li>
		</ul>

	<section id="Plugging">
		
		<h2>4) Plugging It In</h2>
		
		<h3>The last step in this process is plugging in the humidifier. To minimize risk of fire or electrical shock, please
			remember the following:</h3>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Before plugging it in, make sure neither the cord nor device is damaged. Return it to manufacturer if so.</li>
			<li>Be sure to plug the humidifier into a 120V AC electrical outlet. Plugging it into anything else may result in fire or electrical shock.</li>
			<li>Do not plug in the cord with wet hands. Electrical shock could result.</li>
			<li>Keep the cord out of heavy traffic areas. To reduce risk of fire, do not place the cord under a rug or near heat registers.</li>			
		</ul>
